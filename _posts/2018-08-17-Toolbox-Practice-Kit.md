Spent a few hours building my shop out, then constructing the little cell phone holder from Cleaveland Tools, as well as the toolbox practice kit. 

Took 3-4 hours working on the cell phone mount, most of it learning tools. Then 2 hours on the toolbox. Getting more used to the tools and how they work. I have the tailkit practice set from vans I'll crack open tomorrow for a third round of practice stuff.

I'm very impressed with Cleaveland's basic tool set. I upgraded to the pneumatic press, worth the money for sure. I also gave them a call and got a tungsten bucking bar, some clamp clecos, and a couple other little things. Their customer support is amazing.
